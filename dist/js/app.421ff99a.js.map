The system has not only restructured our process by cutting out hours of manpower, paper and human error, it has allowed us to better focus on the personal touches that make our process unique and welcoming. It has freed us from manual errors, and has made our review process so much easier and immediate. It has made our interview season a streamlined paper-free system that allows us to accurately rank our candidates.

It has been an amazing journey to watch how the team worked with us to demonstrate value. We are a small private company, so for us to spend this money was not an easy one initially. However with that said, we could never go back to our old manual process. Our interview sessions used to be longer, and we would have to gather information and then get back together a week or so later once we had a chance to input all the rankings. Now we get through with the interviews, meet 30 minutes later, and are done. The other thing about this is the personal attention to detail they pay to get it right.
